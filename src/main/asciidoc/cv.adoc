DataRefresher was failing to meet the acceptance criteria set by the QA team due to significant memory leaks, race
conditions and inter-process communication issues.

=== Achievements

* I identified the sources of all major defects that had been preventing the QA team accept a build.

* Re-introduced release engineering processes that had been abandoned by the development team.

[[ATT1]]
== AT&T Istel, Redditch, UK

=== Software Engineer (Contract) | September 1992 – January 1993

I implemented a light-weight object request broker for Windows that allowed inter-process communication between
processes on a personal computer and with remote processes running on Unix servers. The object request broker pre-dated
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and was based on Advanced Network Systems Architecture (ANSA).

=== Achievements

* Developed the inter-process communication for co-located Windows applications using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).

* Developed the client-side communication between the Windows applications and server processes over a serial
  connection.
